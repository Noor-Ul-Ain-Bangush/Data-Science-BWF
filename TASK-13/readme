This repository provides comprehensive guides on two important topics in data science: machine learning algorithms and data preprocessing techniques.
The first chapter focuses on Decision Trees and Random Forests, two powerful algorithms used in machine learning for classification and regression tasks. It covers fundamental concepts, such as how decision trees make splits, the impact of parameters like “max_depth” and “n_estimators”, and the concept of feature importance. 
The second chapter offers a detailed guide to essential data cleaning and preprocessing techniques using Pandas. It covers methods for handling missing data, filling and replacing values, removing duplicates, and detecting and capping outliers. These foundational steps are critical for ensuring data quality and reliability in subsequent analysis and machine learning tasks.
