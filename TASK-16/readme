This repository contains Python implementations and documentation for several foundational machine learning algorithms. It includes:

---->> Support Vector Machine (SVM): An algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It finds the optimal hyperplane that best separates classes in a high-dimensional space.
---->> K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A simple, instance-based learning algorithm for classification and regression tasks. It classifies data points based on their proximity to labeled points in the training set.
---->> K-Means Clustering: An unsupervised learning algorithm used for partitioning data into K clusters based on feature similarity. It iteratively assigns data points to the nearest cluster centroid and updates centroids to minimize within-cluster variance.

Each document provides a detailed explanation of the algorithm, its working principles, and Python code examples demonstrating its application.
